## Project Description

This project focuses on mastering Python decorators to enhance database operations in Python applications.<br>
Through hands-on tasks, learners will create custom decorators to log queries, handle connections,
manage transactions, retry failed operations, and cache query results.<br>
The tasks are designed to simulate real-world challenges, providing learners with an in-depth understanding of 
pythonâ€™s capabilities for dynamic and reusable code in database management.<br>

## Learning Objectives

By completing these tasks, professional developers will:

Deepen their knowledge of Python decorators and how they can be used to create reusable, efficient, and clean code.<br>
Enhance database management skills by automating repetitive tasks like connection handling, logging, and caching.<br>
Implement robust transaction management techniques to ensure data integrity and handle errors gracefully.<br>
Optimize database queries by leveraging caching mechanisms to reduce redundant calls.<br>
Build resilience into database operations by implementing retry mechanisms for transient errors.<br>
Apply best practices in database interaction for scalable and maintainable Python applications.<br>

## Requirements

Python 3.8 or higher installed.

SQLite3 database setup with a users table for testing.<br>
A working knowledge of Python decorators and database operations.<br>
Familiarity with Git and GitHub for project submission.<br>
Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail.<br>

## Key Highlights

__Task 0: Logging Database Queries__

	Create a decorator to log all SQL queries executed by a function.
	Learn to intercept function calls to enhance observability.

__Task 1: Handle Database Connections with a Decorator__

	Automate database connection handling with a decorator.
	Eliminate boilerplate code for opening and closing connections.

__Task 2: Transaction Management Decorator__

	Implement a decorator to manage database transactions (commit/rollback).
	Ensure robust error handling and data consistency.

__Task 3: Retry Database Queries__

	Build a decorator to retry database operations on failure.
	Introduce resilience against transient database issues.

__Task 4: Cache Database Queries__

	Implement a decorator to cache query results.
	Optimize performance by avoiding redundant database calls.
